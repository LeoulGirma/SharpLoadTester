### Examples

1. **Basic Load Test**

   Send 1,000,000 GET requests to `https://example.com/api` with a concurrency of 100.

   ```bash
   SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api --total-requests 1000000 --concurrency 100
   ```

2. **POST Requests with Custom Headers and Body**

   Send 500,000 POST requests with custom headers and a JSON body.

   ```bash
   SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api/resource \
                  --method POST \
                  --headers "Content-Type:application/json;Authorization:Bearer token" \
                  --body '{"name":"test","value":123}' \
                  --total-requests 500000 \
                  --concurrency 150
   ```

3. **Rate-Limited Requests with Response Time Threshold**

   Send 100,000 GET requests at a rate of 500 requests per second, monitoring response times with a threshold of 200ms.

   ```bash
   SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api/resource \
                  --requests-per-second 500 \
                  --total-requests 100000 \
                  --concurrency 200 \
                  --threshold 200
   ```

4. **Appending IDs to URLs**

   Send requests with IDs appended to the base URL, ranging from 1 to 1000.

   ```bash
   SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api/resource \
                  --start-id 1 \
                  --end-id 1000 \
                  --total-requests 1000000 \
                  --concurrency 200
   ```

5. **Saving Detailed Report to a File**

   Save the test results in `report.json`.

   ```bash
   SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api \
                  --total-requests 500000 \
                  --concurrency 100 \
                  --output report.json
   ```

## Output & Reporting

Upon completion of a load test, SharpLoadTester provides a comprehensive report summarizing the performance metrics. The report includes:

- **General Metrics**
  - Elapsed Time
  - Total Successes and Failures
  - Success Rate (Status 200 OK)
  - Average Requests Per Second (RPS)

- **Throughput Statistics**
  - Minimum, Median, Average, and Maximum RPS
  - Standard Deviation of RPS
  - 1%, 5%, and 10% Low RPS

- **Response Time Statistics (ms)**
  - Average, Median, Minimum, and Maximum
  - Percentiles: P50, P75, P90, P95, P99

- **System Resource Usage**
  - CPU Usage (%): Minimum, Median, Average, Maximum
  - Memory Usage (MB): Minimum, Average, Maximum

- **Data Transfer**
  - Data Sent (MB)
  - Data Received (MB)

- **Threshold Statistics (if specified)**
  - Number and Percentage of Requests Below and Above the Threshold

- **Failure Logs**
  - Detailed information on failed requests, including URLs and error messages.

### JSON Report

If the `--output` option is specified, SharpLoadTester saves a detailed JSON report containing all the above metrics. This report can be used for further analysis or integration with other tools.

## Logging

SharpLoadTester provides real-time logging to keep you informed about the progress and performance of your load tests. The verbosity of the logs can be controlled using the `--log-level` option.

### Log Levels

- `debug`: Detailed diagnostic information.
- `info`: General operational messages about the progress.
- `warning`: Indications of potential issues.
- `error`: Error events that might still allow the application to continue running.

### Example

```bash
SharpLoadTester --url https://example.com/api \
               --total-requests 100000 \
               --concurrency 100 \
               --log-level debug
```
